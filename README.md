# Devacronymus: a RESTful API, super simple version

## Deployed, live: https://devacronymus.onrender.com/acronyms

This is a collection of **acronyms** commonly used in software development, that can be used for learning purposes. 

Both learning these 50 acronyms and building an app based on the fetched data can be beneficial. I've developed a simple Next.js flashcard app based on this.

For the development, I used Node.js and Express as the only dependency. It's super simple, because:
  - it only uses one GET route
  - the JSON data is saved as a constant inside of the main app.js file

Which is OK at this point, this being a starter project to understand the basics of API development. I'm planning to expand my knowledge by building more complicated REST APIs, learning about secure routes, and getting started with GraphQL.
